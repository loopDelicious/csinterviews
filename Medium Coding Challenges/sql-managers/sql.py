# Each employee should have a primary key that is a unique, autoincrementing integer. Each employee can have (at most) one manager.

# Your Tasks
# Design the database
# Write the CREATE TABLE statement(s) for your design
# Write the INSERT statements to insert this data in
# Write a query that shows each employee and their managers name (if applicable). Make sure it shows everyone, even people without managers.
